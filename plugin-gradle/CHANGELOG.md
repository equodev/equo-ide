### Fixed

### Added
- `chatGPT()`, our [first Eclipse plugin](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide-chatgpt) built and distributed without OSGi or p2, was added to the plugin catalog. ([#144](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/144))

### Changed
- `useChromium` deprecated in favor of `equoChromium` which is now a standard catalog entry. ([#145](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/145))

## [1.5.0] - 2023-06-22
### Added
- `equoIde { dogfood() }` which adds this jar (and its transitive dependencies) into the launched IDE. ([#143](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/143))
  - You can also do `dogfood().ideHook('com.acme.MyIdeHook').ideHook('AnotherIdeHook')` which adds the given IDE hooks into the launched IDE startup sequence. The hooks must have a no-arg constructor. ([#143](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/143))
### Fixed

- Bump all defaults to Eclipse 4.28 (2023-06). ([#137](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/137))
### Fixed
- `branding()` no longer loads SWT classes at definition time, which required build plugins to have SWT on the classpath. ([#135](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/135))

## [1.3.0] - 2023-05-17
### Added

## [1.2.0] - 2023-05-09
### Added
- The ability to set Eclipse preference files. ([#127](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/127))
  - Each catalog entry has its own DSL, e.g. for Eclipse PDE
    ```gradle
    equoIde { 
      pde().missingApiBaseline('Ignore')
    ```
  - Or you can set properties manually on their own
    ```gradle
    equoIde {
      workspaceInit 'instance/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.prefs', {
        prop 'missing_default_api_profile', 'Ignore'
        prop 'missing_plugin_in_baseline', 'Ignore'
      }
    ```
- Control preferences for whitespace and line numbers under `platform`, add classpath variables under `jdt`. ([#128](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/128))
### Fixed
- Eclipse PDE now runs well under Atomos. ([#126](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/126)

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-29
### Added
- We now set the initial perspective of the IDE. ([#125](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/125))
  - It gets set automatically from catalog entries (e.g. `jdt()`), or you can set it manually
  - ```xml
    welcome().perspective('org.eclipse.jdt.ui.JavaPerspective')
    ```

## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-13

## [0.18.0] - 2023-03-13
### Added
- `gradleBuildship()` no longer performs an auto-import by default, you have to do `gradleBuildship().autoImport('.')` which means you can also do `../` or whatever you would like. ([#112](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/112))
### Fixed
- IDE would fail to launch due to a bug in nested jar extraction. ([#111](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/111))

## [0.17.2] - 2023-03-13

### Changed
- P2 operations now use cached values whenever they are available, unless `--clean` or `--refresh-dependencies` is specified.
- `equoIde` now downloads its dependencies only if it is called directly. This means that CI builds don't need to download IDE dependencies. ([#89]https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/89))
  - Also, `equoIde` no longer adds `mavenCentral()` automatically.
### Added
- Gradle DSL now supports `pde`. ([#90](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/90))

## [0.14.2] - 2023-02-17
### Fixed
- Massive performance gains for the `ide` and `p2deps` plugins thanks to improved caching. ([#83](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/83))
- Atomos dependencies are only added when they are needed. ([#83](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/83))

  - We now run without Atomos by default.
  - Specifying `-Dclean` no longer breaks the IDE-already-running detection.

- `--debug-ide` blocks IDE startup and prints instructions to help you attach a remote debugger. ([#69](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/69))
- Default setup now installs Eclipse Buildship, but project import is still broken. ([#66](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/66))

## [0.12.1] - 2023-01-25
### Fixed
- Convert all CLI enums to lowercase because maven arg parsing is case-sensitive. ([#64](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/64))
  - Also switched from `/bin/sh` to `/bin/bash` so that `disown` works correctly when spawning the IDE on linux.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-01-25

### Added
- We now parse the `filter` property of p2 requirements and use it in queries. ([#45](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/45))
- If an ASCII table is too wide, we now add a legend of shortened replacements at the bottom so the rows can be narrower. ([#46](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/46))

    https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/35
