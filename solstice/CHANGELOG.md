- `equoList --request` now shows pure-maven dependencies. ([#151](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/151))
### Fixed
- setting an explicit version for a `Catalog.PureMaven` would erroneously force that same version onto all of its transitive dependencies, now fixed. ([#151](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/151))

- We now parse the `Bundle-IdeHook` header and add those hooks to the IDE startup. ([#148](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/148))
### Changed
- `EquoChromium` is now a standard catalog entry instead of a special-cased sentinel `IdeHook`. ([#145](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/145))

## [1.5.0] - 2023-06-22
### Added
- `Catalog.PureMaven` for plugins which are only published to maven, not p2. ([#143](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/143))
- `P2Model.getPureMaven()` which has a set of maven coordinates which do not partipate in the p2 resolution at all. ([#143](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/143))
- `IdeHookReflected` which is helpful for dogfooding IDE plugins. ([#143](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/143))
### Fixed

### Added
- Tabnine (Copilot-style AI completion) to the plugin catalog. ([#136](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/136))
- AssistAI (ChatGPT) to the plugin catalog. ([#134](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/134))
- EGit to the plugin catalog. ([#133](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/133))
- Bump all defaults to Eclipse 4.28 (2023-06) and handle slf4j 2.x. ([#137](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/137))
### Fixed
- OSGi services implemented by inner classes (e.g. `SomeClass$InnerClass`) are now instantiated correctly.
- `IdeHookBranding` no longer loads SWT classes at definition time, which required build plugins to have SWT on the classpath. ([#135](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/135))
- Implemented `BundleWiring.getClassLoader` which fixes Log4j. ([#136](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/136))
- Copyright notices in headers. ([#138](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/138))

## [1.3.2] - 2023-05-25

## [1.3.1] - 2023-05-23
### Fixed
- Fail more loudly when the p2 client gets 502 errors. ([#130](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/130))
### Changed
- Changed the default location for all p2 data (metadata, bundle pool, queries, and nested jars) to be `~/.m2/repository/dev/equo/p2-data/`. ([#131](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/131))
  - If this location fails for some reason, it then tries `$GRADLE_USER_HOME/caches/p2-data`
  - This improves CI caching and follows user feedback ([spotless#1687](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/1687), )

## [1.3.0] - 2023-05-17
### Added
- Added `patch-chromium-swt.jar` which gets packaged into the `src/main/resources` of `solstice.jar` to support replacing the standard SWT Browser with Equo Chromium. ([#123](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/123))

## [1.2.0] - 2023-05-09
### Added
- The ability to set Eclipse preference files. ([#127](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/127))
- Fix issues to make Eclipse PDE work better. ([#126](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/126))
  - Shim now calls activators in extension (fragment) bundles. 
  - Shim bundles now report their version correctly.
  - We now generate a `bundles.info` file so that PDE can parse the "Running" target platform.
  - Remove Atomos URL workaround for Eclipse 4.27 and later (fixes [#40](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/40)).
  - When running under Atomos, we now patch the `EquinoxBundle` class so that `getEntry("/")` returns the jar file itself of null.
- Control preferences for whitespace and line numbers under `platform`, add classpath variables under `jdt`. ([#128](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/128))

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-29
### Added
- Added `SignedJars` which can strip signatures when necessary (e.g. a signed Eclipse jar contributing classes to the same package as one of its nested jars). ([#116](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/116))
- `NestedJars.transitiveDeps` is now smart about keeping `slf4j-nop` off the classpath and only adding `slf4j` deps when they are absent ([#115](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/115/commits/6bcf66e9e35d2ca4ab1b6da1bae1ddbf0c17fd63) and [#110]()https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/110/commits/0cf444ac9d19844ecbce5f7aac23095816b42ec6)
- Can now set the initial perspective, and the catalog entries autosuggest based on the first catalog entry specified in the build. ([#125](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/125))
### Changed
- Update version catalog to latest `2022-03` versions of everything. ([#110](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/110))
### Fixed
- Fix branding for title bar and icon. ([#117](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/117) fixes [#87](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/87))
- Fix xml parsing errors. ([#110](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/110/commits/15b0be521a4ae7fb20692b3192968c69f6d04f43) fixes [#118](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/118))
- Handle metadata jars with multiple entries. (fixes [#120](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/120))

## [1.0.3] - 2023-03-13
### Fixed
- `NestedJars.confirmAllNestedJarsArePresentOnClasspath` wasn't adding nested jars onto the classpath of the launched application, oops. ([#114](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/114))

## [1.0.2] - 2023-03-13

- Fix `isClean` detection for IDE hooks. ([#113](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/113))

## [1.0.1] - 2023-03-13
### Fixed
- `BuildPluginIdeMain` was using the central cache directory instead of the IDE-specific directory, oops. ([#111](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/111))

## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-13
### Changes
- The offline query cache now includes the Solstice version in the key. ([#108](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/108))
### Fixed
- More workarounds for errant Eclipse artifacts in `4.23`. ([#108](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/108) fixes [#106](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/106))

## [0.19.2] - 2023-03-13
### Fixed

- `ShimIdeBootstrapServices` is now compatible with older Eclipse versions. ([#104](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/104))
- ClassPath order when launching with nested jars now respects the order of `Bundle-ClassPath` entries. ([#104](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/104))
- `Solstice.warnAndModifyManifestsToFix` no longer warns about nested jars which export the same packages as their containing bundle. ([#104](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/104))

## [0.18.0] - 2023-03-10
### Added
- Catalog now includes `groovy`. ([#103](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/103))
- `Solstice.startWithoutTransitives()`. ([#102](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/102))
  - `QueryCache` renamed to `P2QueryCache`

- Catalog now includes `m2e`. ([#95](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/95))
### Fixed
- Bundles without activators are now treated as `lazy=true` since there's no need to eagerly activate them. ([#90](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/90))
- Concurrent modification errors in service registry have been fixed by adding a custom datastructure. ([#90](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/90))
- We can now handle p2 update sites without a `p2.index` file. ([#91](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/91))
- Solstice Shim's URL handler now handles missing resources correctly. ([#91](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/91) and [#95](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/95))
- The Eclipse home location system property is now a proper `file:/` URL. ([#92](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/92))

- Compatibility improvements to the P2 client. ([#97](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/97))

## [0.16.0] - 2023-02-19
### Added
- `Catalog` feature for specifying p2 repos in a user-friendly way. ([#86](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/86))

## [0.15.0] - 2023-02-17
### Added
- `P2QueryResult` which strips a `P2Query` down to pnly the maven coordinates and jars. ([#85](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/85))
	- Easy to cache, which allows us to grab massive speedup gains.
	- Also fixed a bug which had been disabling our offline P2 metadata cache. 
### Fixed
- Atomos was changed from an `implementation` dependency to `compileOnly`. ([#83](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/83))

## [0.14.1] - 2023-02-13
### Fixed
- Missing OSGi capabilities are now handled the same as missing bundles and packages. ([#80](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/80) fixes [#74](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/74))
- JUnit launch now works correctly. ([#81](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/81))
  - `Bundle.getEntry("/")` now returns `file://blah.jar` URL, instead of the `jar:file://blah.jar!/subpath` that it normally returns.
  - We now remove the `Bundle-ClassPath` header from Atomos and Shim modes, because `NestedJars` ensures that it is not necessary.

## [0.14.0] - 2023-02-12
### Added
- Introduced `Capability` which takes OSGi `Provide-Capability`/`Require-Capability` into account. ([#71](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/71))
  - In particular, this means that we don't need to do any manual startup ordering anymore.
  - Also reverted from SLF4J 2.x to 1.x because 2.x uses fancy parts of the capability system that nothing else in Eclipse seems to use.
### Fixed
- No more errors on filesystems which don't support atomic move. ([#73](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/73))
- Pure solstice can now run the full Eclipse IDE correctly, including `UIEventTopic`. ([#75](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/75) fixes [#33](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/33))
- Better error handling for IdeHooks. ([#76](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/76))

## [0.13.0] - 2023-02-05
### Added
- `IdeHookWelcome` for opening a browser on welcome, and `PartDescriptor` for creating IDE parts without any `plugin.xml` metadata. ([#65](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/65))
- `BuildPluginIdeMain` now has a field `debugIde` which launches the IDE with vmargs setup for remote debugging. ([#69](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/69))
### Changed
- Complete revamp of bundle activation for Atomos and Solstice to emulate lazy activation. ([#68](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/68))

## [0.12.1] - 2023-01-25
### Fixed
- Convert all CLI enums to lowercase because maven arg parsing is case-sensitive. ([#64](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/64))
  - Also switched from `/bin/sh` to `/bin/bash` so that `disown` works correctly when spawning the IDE on linux.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-01-25
### Added
- P2Multitool now lives inside Solstice so it can be used from any build plugin. ([#61](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/61))
- `IdeLockFile` can now store and recall the classpath, to help prompt the user to clean when necessary. ([#62](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/62))
  - Improvements to the launch experience by calling `forceActive()` on the splash and initial IDE windows.
  - Delayed PID lockfile instantiation until the workbench has opened, should be more reliable to improve ([#44](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/44))
### Fixed
- Minor bug in `IdeLockFile`. ([`394ff8`](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/commit/394ff81f4b2c876416fc07ff12d4a33b5ae41164))
- Offline caching of p2 dependencies and metadata now works again. ([`7e3f03`](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/61/commits/7e3f036714d08635f03853bf27588f0ebd187319))

## [0.11.0] - 2023-01-23
### Added
- `IdeHook` system for defining extremely simple plugins. ([#56](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/56))
  - Moved IDE-related classes into `dev.equo.ide` package.
  - `DepsResolve` now works for `-SNAPSHOT` versions published to maven local, aiding integration testing.
- Support for setting title, icon, and splash screen. ([#58](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/58) implements [#49](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/49))
### Changed
- We are now dogfooding `dev.equo.p2deps` to get the dependencies we need for Solstice. ([#55](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/55))
  - Way simpler than our previous elaborate build, no more `NestedJars` in our test classpath, but they aren't needed to launch IDE without atomos. 

## [0.10.0] - 2023-01-11
### Added
- `WorkspaceRegistry` now supports cleaning. ([#50](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/50))
- Introduce `P2Model` so that Gradle and Maven DSLs can drive guts through a common model type. ([#51](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/51))
  - We also now run CI against unix and windows.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-01-09
### Added
- We now parse the `filter` property of p2 requirements and use it in queries. ([#45](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/45))
- If an ASCII table is too wide, we now add a legend like `§§ feature.feature.group` at the bottom so the rows can be narrower. ([#46](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/46))
### Fixed
- Partial improvements to process launching ([#47](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/47) partial fix for [#44](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/44))

## [0.8.0] - 2023-01-06
### Added
- Add tools to help debug classpath issues. ([#43](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/43))
  - Rename `IdeMain` to `BUildPluginIdeMain` because it has a weird interface that only makes sense for our build plugins.
  - Add `enum DebugClasspath` for dumping all classpath entires (names or full paths)
  - Stop sorting classpath entries implicitly, make it explicit via `Launcher.copyAndSortClasspath`, which is now used by all build plugins.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-01-06
### Added
- `IdeMain` has gained a `-useAtomos true` flag which, when enabled, uses [Atomos](https://github.com/apache/felix-atomos) as a single-classloader OSGi connector to Equinox. This is used instead of the OSGi runtime which is built-in to Solstice. ([#36](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/36))
  - It is recommended to set `-useAtomos true` for the foreseeable future, because it has better compatibility with existing applications.
  - For simple applications, you can experiment with `-useAtomos false`.
- Improve process launching. ([#39](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/39))
- Respect optionality of p2 requirements. ([#41](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/pull/41) fixes [#35](https://github.com/equodev/equo-ide/issues/35))

## [0.6.0] - 2022-12-16
### Added

### Added
- More P2 client improvements.

## [0.4.0] - 2022-12-11
### Added

- Tons of improvements to the P2 client.

## [0.3.1] - 2022-12-07
### Fixed
- Javadoc on all public classes.

## [0.3.0] - 2022-12-07
### Added
- Changes to allow end users to set the release manually.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-12-07
### Added
- The `dev.equo.solstice.p2` package which has a simple implementation of p2.

## [0.1.1] - 2022-12-06
- Most of the Eclipse JDT UI now lights up, but we're still having problems with the JDT project nature.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-12-05
- First release to test publishing infrastructure, not meant for end users.
